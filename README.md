A calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and Flask provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic mathematical operations. The HTML file establishes the structure of the application, while the CSS file styles it for an appealing visual experience. Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, is used to handle server-side logic and dynamic content.

In the HTML file, the structure typically includes a header displaying the application title, an input field for the user to enter mathematical expressions, and a set of buttons for numbers, operators, and actions (e.g., clear, backspace, calculate). Each button is assigned a JavaScript function to update the expression in the input field accordingly.

The CSS file enhances the visual presentation, defining styles for the layout, fonts, buttons, and overall aesthetics. It ensures a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, creating a seamless user experience.

Flask's role is to handle the server-side logic. It defines routes for rendering the HTML template, receiving form submissions, and processing calculations. For instance, a route might render the calculator template on the home page and another route may handle form submissions for calculating expressions.
